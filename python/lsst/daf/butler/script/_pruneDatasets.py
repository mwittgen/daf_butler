        The astropy tables that will be or were deleted, by default None.
    state : ``PruneDatasetsResult.State``, optional

    Attributes
    ----------
    tables

    state : ``PruneDatasetsResult.State``
        The current state of the action.
    onConfirmation : `Callable[None, None]`

    repo, collections, datasets, where, disassociate_tags, unstore, purge_run, dry_run, confirm, find_all
):
    """Prune datasets from a repository.

    Parameters
    ----------
    repo : `str`
        URI to the location of the repo or URI to a config file describing the
        repo and its location.
    collections : iterable [`str`]
        A list of glob-style search string that identify the collections to
        search for.
    datasets : iterable [`str`]
        A list of glob-style search string that identify the dataset type names
        to search for.
    where : `str`
        A string expression similar to a SQL WHERE clause.  May involve any
        column of a dimension table or (as a shortcut for the primary key
        column of a dimension table) dimension name.
    find_all : `bool`
        If False, for each result data ID, will only delete the dataset from
        the first collection in which a dataset of that dataset type appears
        (according to the order of ``collections`` passed in).  If used,
        ``collections`` must specify at least one expression and must not
        contain wildcards. This is the inverse of ``QueryDataset``'s find_first
        option.
    disassociate_tags : `list` [`str`]
        TAGGED collections to disassociate the datasets from. If not `None`
        then ``purge_run`` must be `None`.
    unstore : `bool`
        Same as the unstore argument to ``Butler.pruneDatasets``.
    purge_run : `str`
        Completely remove datasets from the ``Registry``. Note that current
        implementation accepts any RUN-type collection, but will remove
        datasets from all collections.
    dry_run : `bool`
        Get results for what would be removed but do not remove.
    confirm : `bool`
        Get results for what would be removed and return the results for
        display & confirmation, with a completion function to run after
        confirmation.

    The matrix of legal & illegal combinations of purge, unstore, and
    disassociate is this:
    - none of (purge, unstore, disassociate): error, nothing to do
    - purge only: ok
    - unstore only: ok
    - disassociate only: ok
    - purge+unstore: ok, just ignore unstore (purge effectively implies
      unstore)
    - purge+disassociate: this is an error (instead of ignoring disassociate),
      because that comes with a collection argument that we can't respect, and
      that might be confusing (purge will disassociate from all TAGGED
      collections, not just the one given)
    - purge+unstore+disassociate: an error, for the same reason as just
      purge+disassociate
    - unstore+disassociate: ok; these operations are unrelated to each other

    Returns
    -------
    results : ``PruneDatasetsResult``
        A data structure that contains information about datasets for removal,
        removal status, and options to continue in some cases.
